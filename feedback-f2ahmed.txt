I liked the way your presentation is structured. its easy to follow and has a good layout. I would explain more about what "initializing state" means. you explain the other parts quite clearly, but i start to loose track a little bit about what your code is doing there. Also i liked that your project started out with a  lot of information about the climate. mayb tie your code to some of the explanations or what climit (the library/package you are explaining) to some of the laws you mentioned to make your presentation tie together really well! overall, great job
